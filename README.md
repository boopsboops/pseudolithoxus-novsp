## Abstract

The rapids-dwelling suckermouth catfish genus _Pseudolithoxus_ was previously only known from the Guiana-Shield-draining Orinoco and Casiquiare river systems of Colombia and Venezuela, but new records expand this range considerably further into the Amazon basin of Brazil, and include occurrences from rivers draining the northern Brazilian Shield. These highly disjunct records are now placed in an evolutionary and phylogeographic context using a dated species tree constructed from mitochondrial (_Cytb_) and nuclear (_RAG1_) gene sequence data. Due to mito-nuclear discordance, we also delimit the putative species using statistical coalescent models and a range of additional metrics. We infer that at least two species of _Pseudolithoxus_ are present in the Amazon basin: _P. nicoi_, previously only recorded from the Casiquiare River but now also reported from the upper rio Negro, and a new species&mdash;which we describe herein&mdash;from south-draining Guiana Shield and north-draining Brazilian Shield drainages. Our data reject a simple model of Miocene vicariance in the group following uplift of the Uaup√©s Arch separating the Orinoco and Amazon systems, and instead suggest more complex dispersal scenarios through palaeo-connections in the Pliocene and also via the contemporary rio Negro and rio Madeira in the late Pleistocene.
