## The description of a new species of *Pseudolithoxus* Isbrücker and Werner from Brazil (Siluriformes, Loricariidae) 
------
### Abstract

One suckermouth catfish species (Loricariidae, *Pseudolithoxus* sp. n.) collected on the survey we describe as new, and can be distinguished from its congeners on the basis of unique colour pattern: body with large pale spots on a dark background (versus bars in *P. kelsorum* and *P. tigris*; large dark spots on a pale background in *P. dumus*; and small white dots on a black background in *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax*). This species represents the first *Pseudolithoxus* from the Amazon basin of Brazil.

### Introduction

The Rio Nhamundá is one of the south-draining Guiana Shield tributaries of the Rio Amazonas, Brazil. The river is located between the Uatumã-Jatapú and Trombetas rivers <u>(Figure 1)</u>, and comprises the administrative border between Amazonas State and Pará State. Chemically, the Rio Nhamundá is of the clearwater type (<u>Carvalho de Lima & Araujo-Lima, 2004</u>), being poor in sediments, dissolved minerals, and humic compounds <u>(Crampton, 2011)</u>.

We also provide the description of a new suckermouth catfish species which was collected on the trip.


### Materials and methods

#### Field sampling techniques

Fishes were collected during the November 2013 dry season using a combination of methods mostly targeting larger species: gill netting, rod and line fishing, spear fishing, hand netting, and hand catching using snorkelling equipment. Fishes were photographed alive where possible, and then euthanised using a eugenol (clove oil) solution. Tissue samples&mdash;usually from muscle and fin membranes on the right-side pectoral-fin base&mdash;were taken from a subset of specimens and stored in absolute ethanol. Fishes to be retained as vouchers were then fixed in 10% formalin for several days before being transferred to 70% alcohol for long-term storage. 

#### Measurements and meristic techniques

Measurements of preserved material were taken with dial callipers to a precision of 0.1 mm. All measurements and counts for symmetrical features were taken from the left side of the specimen.  For loricariids, morphometric measurements and meristic counts follow <u>Armbruster (2003)</u>, and terminology for lateral plate rows follows <u>Schaefer (1997)</u>. Counts of cheek plate odontodes included only the long, highly hypertrophied odontodes on the posterior part of the plate. The dorsal-fin spinelet is included as a spine, and the nuchal plate is not included in the predorsal plate row count. Terminology of colour pattern follows <u>Kottelat and Freyhof (2007)</u>. The symbolic codes for institutional resource collections follows <u>Sabaj Pérez (2013)</u>. <!--Unless otherwise stated, measurements are expressed as percentages of standard length (SL) or head length (HL).--> 

#### Molecular methods

DNA barcodes were generated for one to three individuals per species. DNA was extracted using a ... TBC


### Results: taxon treatment

#### Description

The holotype of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. is pictured in Figure 2. Morphometric measurements and meristic counts are presented in Table 1. Largest specimen collected was 147.4 mm (holotype<!-- PN11 -->). Body extremely dorso-ventrally compressed, with flattened surfaces both dorsally and ventrally. Shape of head-profile from dorsal view rounded to blunted-square. Head with pronounced medial ridge between nares and snout tip. Dorsal operculum of the iris present.

Sucking disk large, approximately as wide as is long, lacking fimbriae, and with the ventral surface bearing small buccal papillae. Maxillary barbels short. Teeth villiform and bicuspid. Lateral cusp of teeth roughly one-half to two-thirds the length of the medial cusp. Premaxillary teeth 42-81 (median 56, holotype 55). Dentary teeth 33-85 (median 65, holotype 69).

Short hypertrophied odontodes on snout and opercle in both females and males. Cheek plates evertible to 90&deg;, bearing 21-35 long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes (median 30, holotype 34). Pectoral-fin spines also carrying long, distally-hooked hypertrophied odontodes along almost their entire length in mature male specimens over around 100 mm. Short tentacules (fleshy sheaths partially detached from odontodes) present on snout and pectoral fins. 

Pectoral fins extremely elongated, and when adpressed, reach to nearly the insertion of the anal fin in mature male specimens over approximately 100 mm. Fin-ray counts recorded as follows: dorsal fin II,7; pectoral fin I,6; pelvic fin I,5; anal fin I,5 (I,2 in one specimen); caudal fin I,14,I (I,13,I in one specimen); dorsal procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens); ventral procurrent caudal rays four (three in two specimens). Adipose fin present with short, straight spine. All fin spines with odontodes. Branched fin rays also bearing odontodes, but significantly fewer on the branched anal-fin rays of small specimens. Caudal fin emarginate with lower lobe slightly longer than upper.

Snout and flanks fully plated. Abdomen naked. Lateral plates carrying rows of small odontodes. Plating absent from small area at start of lateral line canal at conjunction with pterotic-supracleithrum, and from an area at the base of the pelvic fin. Plate counts recorded as follows: predorsal plate rows two; lateral mid-dorsal plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); lateral median plates 24; lateral mid-ventral plates 19-21 (mode 20, holotype 20); caudal peduncle plate rows three; azygous pre-adipose plates one (two in one specimen); and interdorsal plate rows six-seven (mode seven, holotype six).

Colour pattern of preserved material comprises pale spots on a dark grey background giving the overall impression of reticulations. In life, the pale spots are a light olive-green colour (Fig YYY). Spotted pattern is present on the head, body and fins. Spots increase in size posteriorly, being smaller than the pupil on the snout, and larger than the orbit on the caudal peduncle. Abdomen pale with scattered melanophores. Caudal fin with thin, white distal band. Odontodes golden orange-yellow, with darker orange tips. 

Sexual dimorphism is subtle in *Pseudolithoxus*. In mature individuals of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n., the shape of the pelvic fin was seen to differ; in males the third branched ray is noticeably longer than the first branched ray, where in females it is roughly the same length. Males also appear to have longer pectoral-fin spines carrying longer odontodes. <!-- examples: PN09 female and PN10 male.-->

#### Diagnosis

Following <u>Armbruster and Provenzano (2000)</u>, <u>Armbruster (2004)</u>, and <u>Lujan and Armbruster (2011)</u>, key characters distinguishing *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. from all ancistrin Loricariidae&mdash;except other *Pseudolithoxus*&mdash;are as follows: three rows of lateral plates on the caudal peduncle; lateral plates without pronounced keels; fully plated snout lacking tentacles; hypertrophied odontodes on the snout in both females and males; lack of whisker-like odontodes on the cheek plates; extremely hypertrophied odontodes on an elongated pectoral-fin spine in both females and males; sucking disk without fimbriae; and greater than 20 teeth per jaw ramus.

Within the genus *Pseudolithoxus*, *P. XXX* sp. n. can be distinguished from: *P. tigris* and *P. kelsorum* by having a colour pattern comprised of spots (vs. bars); from *P. dumus* from having large pale spots on a dark background vs. large dark spots on a light background; and from *P. nicoi* and *P. anthrax* by having a colour pattern comprised of large pale spots generally equal to or larger than pupil diameter posterior to the head on a dark background vs. dots much smaller than pupil diameter on a black background.

#### Etymology
*Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. is named ... . In the German aquarium literature, fishes of this genus are known as  due to their wing-like elongated pectoral-fins <u>(Seidel & Evers, 2005)</u>. We propose the English vernacular name "... flyer catfish", and propose the Portuguese vernacular name "acarí-bodó ..." for the species.

#### Ecology and distribution

<!-- What about the 1993 Trombetas specimens at INPA?-->

The species is currently only known from one location on the main river stem of the lower Rio Nhamundá. The type series was collected in shallow (depth &lt; 1.5 m), fast flowing water over a substrate of eroded bedrock. The fishes were living among the narrow cracks between the rocks, and were abundant at the sampling site. However, this type of  habitat was not frequently encountered on the lower Nhamundá, and we did not find the species associated with the more common woody-debris sites, or the rocky sites lacking any appreciable water current. Water temperature and conductivity were 28.3&deg;C and 6 &micro;s/cm. Syntopic species encountered during the night survey included: *Leporinus*, *Symphysodon*, *Cichla*, *Pimelodella*, and *Gymnotus*. *Pseudolithoxus* was the dominant loricariid in this habitat.

#### Molecular data
Three paratypes of *Pseudolithoxus XXX* sp. n. (CTGA_NNN) were sequenced for the COI DNA barcode region, and following the 'GenSeq' nomenclature of <u>Chakrabarty et al., (2013)</u> these specimens bear the 'genseq-2 COI' annotation. The sequences were NNN bp in length and variability ... TBC. GenBank accession numbers are listed in Materials.

### Discussion and Conclusions

#### New species

<u>Armbruster & Provenzano (2000)</u> described four *Lasiancistrus* from the Upper Orinoco drainage, species which were later moved by Isbrücker & Werner <u>(Isbrücker et al., 2001)</u> to the new genus *Pseudolithoxus*. <u>Lujan & Birindelli (2011)</u> later added an additional barred species also from the upper Orinoco, *P. kelsorum*, to the genus. <u>Lujan & Birindelli (2011)</u> also list the homoplastic synapomorphies of *Pseudolithoxus* following <u>Armbruster (2008)</u>, viz. "posteromedial invagination of ceratobranchial 5 present (vs. absent), dorsomedial process on pterotic-supracleithrum present (vs. absent), and three to eight vertebrae from the first normal neural spine behind dorsal fin to spine under preadipose plate (vs. nine or more)". The genus *Pseudolithoxus* was found by both <u>Armbruster (2008)</u> with morphological data and <u>Covain & Fisch-Muller (2012)</u> with molecular data, to be the sistergroup to *Ancistrus*+*Lasiancistrus*. 

*Pseudolithoxus XXX* is the first of the genus reported from Brazil, and in particular it is the first recorded from the Amazon-draining southern rivers of the Guiana Shield, raising interesting biogeographic questions about the dispersal routes, vicariant events, and zoogeographic filters of the region <u>(Winemiller et al., 2008)</u>. Regardless, only a molecular treatment of the genus will allow detailed hypotheses regarding the group's distribution to be tested. Whether the genus has a wider distribution than currently known awaits confirmation, but <u>Seidel & Evers (2005)</u> illustrate a fish purportedly from the Rio Guaporé (upper Madeira drainage) on the Brazil-Bolivia border, a highly disjunct location from the current known distribution of the genus on the Guiana Shield.

<!-- *P. nicoi* from the Casiquiare Canal is likely to be also found in the Upper Rio Negro of Brazil. -->
